Active learning comparison on MNIST data by appending labels to a continuously growing data set. Here we compare the difference of appending data points with the highest and lowest prediction certainty. We start of with a data set of unlabeled MNIST images of size $N=10000$. An initial size $n_{initial}=1000$ is labeled. With this inital data, a model is trained on the $n_{initial}$ data points. The trained model then predicts on the remaining $N-n_{initial}$ unlabeled data points and we append $n=100$ of these predictions and use the model's prediction as a label to our growing data set. This process is repeated with but now with a data set with size $n_{initial}+n$. The main idea is that a larger data set should result in better performance, however automating the
